CWIPI's documentation
*********************

**CWIPI** (Coupling With Interpolation Parallel Interface) is a C++/C library for code coupling in parallel.
It ensures exchanges of interpolated fiels through a non conforming geometric interface.

To do a coupling with a supervisor OpenPALM software (CERFACS) or a user made Python script calling the Python interface of CWIPI can be used.
