New CWIPI
#########

Released in 2023, this version relies on the parallel computational geometry library **ParaDiGM** which is developed by the same team as CWIPI.

Advanced features
=================


User-defined spatial interpolation
----------------------------------

Users can perform customized spatial interpolation based on the geometric mapping computed by CWIPI.
To do so, one needs to provide CWIPI with a pointer to a user-written interpolation function (via ``CWP_Field_interp_function_set`` in C).
Each Field object can have a specific user-defined spatial interpolation.
The following sections show how to retrieve all the information required to write such a function.

Additional exchange features
----------------------------

CWIPI v.1 offers two additional means to exchange data between the coupled codes.
As opposed to fields, these data need not be related to the interface meshes.
