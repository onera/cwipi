- API :
  - PDM_overlay : Intersection of two plane meshes
  - PDM_closest_points     : Parallel knn algorithm
  - PDM_dmesh_partitioning : New implementation of parallel meshe partitioning (old implementation : PDM_part)
  - PDM_multipart : Parallel meshes partitioning with preservation of links between meshes
  - PDM_mesh_location : A partitioned point cloud location in a partitionned mesh

- Internal functions :
  - PDM_mean_values : Polygon and Polyedra mean values (generalization of barycentric coordinates)
  - PDM_ho_basis : High order basis for tetrahedron, hexahedron, prism, pyramid, triangle and quadrangle
  - PDM_ho_location : Point location into a high order curved element
  - PDM_logging : Managing a logging file
  - PDM_dconnectivity_transform : Set of function to perform distributed operation on connectivity (combine, transform, reverse)
  - PDM_dmesh_nodal_elements_utils : Operations about a dmesh_nodal mesh
  - PDM_point_location : Point location in a PDM_mesh_nodal
  - PDM_tetrahedron : Elementary functions about tetrahedron
  - PDM_triangulate : Polygon triangulation
  - PDM_para_graph_dual : Parallel building of a dual graph mesh
  - PDM_partitioning_algorithm : Steps of the partitioning algorithm called from PDM_dmesh_partitioning
